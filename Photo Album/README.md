## 📸 Photo Album

A dynamic, responsive photo album that uses a Masonry layout to perfectly organize images of varying sizes. This app allows users to view images in a fullscreen modal for a better viewing experience.

## 🌟 Features

1. Dynamic Masonry Layout: Images are automatically arranged based on their aspect ratios for a visually appealing design.
2. Fullscreen Modal: Click on any image to view it in a fullscreen modal.
3. Smooth Hover Effects: Images scale slightly on hover, adding a modern touch.
4. Responsive Design: The gallery works seamlessly across all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML: For the basic structure of the app.
- CSS: For styling the gallery, including animations and layout.
- JavaScript: For dynamic layout adjustments and interactive features.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Dynamic Image Placement:The app calculates the aspect ratio of each image to determine its height in the Masonry grid. Images are placed in a way that minimizes gaps between them.
- Interactive Modal:Clicking on an image opens it in a fullscreen modal. Users can close the modal by clicking the close button.
- Responsive Behavior: The layout adjusts automatically to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
